OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project: WEATHER FORECAST APP

OBJECTIVE

This weather forecast app aims to provide users with up-to-date weather information.
Users can enter the name of a city to get weather details, which are dynamically displayed in the app.
The design features a simple and intuitive interface for ease of use. It integrates with external libraries
for enhanced functionality and styling.

KEY ACTIVITES

City Name Input: Users can enter the name of a city in the input box to request weather information.
Weather Data Retrieval: The app fetches real-time weather data from an external API based on the user's input. 
Dynamic Display: The retrieved weather information is dynamically appended to the weather-body section using JavaScript.
Error Handling and Notifications: The app uses SweetAlert to display error messages or notifications for invalid city names
or other issues.
